In proposal mode the plan remains pending until the user applies its card. Supply replaces_plan_id only when explicitly revising a saved plan.",
    "log_workout_set": "Log an actually completed set in the active workout session. Never choose the next template. Use exact exercise name or an explicit exercise_id. Ask for the intended session when none is active. For multiple identical sets use distinct set_index values; omission means the first unfinished set.",
    "create_diet_plan": "Save suggested meals as a diet plan. This does not log consumed food or change eaten totals. Respect allergies and preferences. Proposal mode requires explicit application. Revisions preserve the earlier plan.",
    "log_food": "Log only food the user explicitly reports eating or explicitly requests logging. Never log a dinner suggestion as consumed. Mark free-text nutrition as coach_estimate; use nutrition_label only when the user provides the label values. Do not invent labels. Quantities and nutrition numbers refer to the entire consumed portion.",
    "set_goal": "Save an explicitly requested goal. Do not invent the starting strength or measurements; ask if essential. Habit goals in sessions use actual weekly completed sessions. Explicit strength/body progress needs a user update. A nutrition goal can opt into daily_protein progress.",
    "get_today": "Read authoritative local-day totals and dated weekly completed session counts. Never recompute totals in the model. A profile_incomplete result means targets are missing. Ask one focused question.",
    "get_profile": "Read the saved profile, preferences, allergies, equipment and separate scan consents. Do not infer missing personal facts. This tool exposes no secrets.",
    "get_saved_plans": "Read active workout and diet plans. Meals here are suggestions, not consumed food. Pending proposals do not appear as active plans.",
    "get_goals": "Read saved goals and authoritative progress calculated from real logs where configured. Do not infer 1RM or body measurements.",
